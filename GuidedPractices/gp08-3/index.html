<h1>Guided Practice 8.3</h1>

<p>Modify 08-2-binary-search.java to design the following method:</p>

<pre>
    static int count_occurrences (int[] A, int tgt) {

        // GIVEN: A non-decreasing array A of integers and an integer
        // target 'tgt'
        // RETURNS: the number of occurrences of tgt in A.
</pre>

<p>Remember that your invariants, halting measure, and your
 justification of the halting measure
 are at least as important as your code.</p>


<p><a href="solution.java" >[ANSWER]</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To solution uses the <kbd>PdpTestSuite</kbd>
class, which we will use for testing in the Java portion of the
course.  To run the solution, you will need to have an up-to-date JDK
installed.  
Download <a href="solution.java"
>solution.java</a>  and <a href="PdpTestSuite.java" >PdpTestSuite.java</a> into the
same directory.   Compile PdpTestSuite by saying <kbd>javac
PdpTestSuite.java</kbd> .   Then compile and run solution.java
according to the instructions at the top of that file.
