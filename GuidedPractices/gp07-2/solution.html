<h1>Guided Practice 7.2 (Solution)</h1>

<p>A valid invariant for a function has the following property:</p>

<blockquote>If the function is called with an argument that satisfies
the invariant, then each recursive call of that function satisfies the
invariant.</blockquote>

<p>We say that the function <em>preserves</em> the invariant.</p>

<p>Consider the following function definition:</p>

<pre>
;; f : Integer -> Integer
;; GIVEN/RETURNS: omitted
;; INVARIANT: to be filled in
(define (f n)
  (cond
    [(zero? n) 1]
    [else (* 2 (f (- n 3)))]))
</pre>

<p>Which of the following possible invariants does this function
preserve?</p>

<ol>

  <li><kbd>n</kbd> is a non-negative integer. <strong>ANSWER:
  </strong> No.  If n=2, then n-3 is not a non-negative integer.</li>
  
  <li><kbd>n</kbd> is of the form <kbd>3k</kbd> for some non-negative integer
  <kbd>k</kbd>  <strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes.  Consider the
  possibilities for k.  If k = 0, then n = 0, and the function does
  not make any calls.  If k &gt; 0, then k-1 is non-negative, and
  therefore 3k-3 = 3(k-1) is non-negative.</li> 

  <li><kbd>n</kbd> is of the form <kbd>3k+1</kbd> for some integer
  <kbd>k</kbd>.  <strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes.  If n = 3k+1, then n-3
  = (3k+1)-3 = 3(k-1), which is still an integer.  Note than in this
  invariant, we didn't ask for k to be non-negative.  If we had asked
  for k to be non-negative, then the invariant does not hold at n = 1.</li> 
</ol>
