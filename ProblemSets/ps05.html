    <p>
      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      designing functions that deal with trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's Intermediate Student Language (ISL)
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the directory with your solutions.
      Then import <code>rackunit</code> and this library
      by including the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file.
      Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set05</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set05</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both parts, you should require <code>rackunit</code> and
      <code>"extras.rkt"</code> but nothing else.
    </p>

      <li>
        (Arithmetic Expressions)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this first part of Problem Set 05, you will design
          data types that make it possible to represent arithmetic
          expressions such as <code>x+(3*y)</code>.
          This first part of the problem set consists of nothing
          but routine data definitions and a few simple functions
          for creating and observing values of the data types you
          define.  The functions you are asked to define should not
          have to do any non-trivial computations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific data types you must design and implement
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <strong><code>Literal</code></strong>
            represents a real number.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong><code>Variable</code></strong>
            represents a name whose meaning will depend upon
            the context in which it appears.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <strong><code>Operation</code></strong>
            represents an arithmetic operation such as addition or
            division.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong><code>Call</code></strong>
            represents a function call.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong><code>Block</code></strong>
            represents a variable definition and an expression
            within which that variable may be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <strong><code>ArithmeticExpression</code></strong>
            is one of the following:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Literal</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Variable</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Operation</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Call</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Block</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that defines all of the data types named above and
          also defines and provides all 18 of the functions
          specified below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are giving you two data definitions,
          for the itemization types
          <code>OperationName</code> and <code>ArithmeticExpression</code>.
          You should copy these data definitions into your
          <code>q1.rkt</code> file without changing them:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; An OperationName is represented as one of the following strings:
          ;;;     -- "+"      (indicating addition)
          ;;;     -- "-"      (indicating subtraction)
          ;;;     -- "*"      (indicating multiplication)
          ;;;     -- "/"      (indicating division)
          ;;;
          ;;; OBSERVER TEMPLATE:
          ;;; operation-name-fn : OperationName -&gt; ??
          #;
          (define (operation-name-fn op)
            (cond ((string=? op "+") ...)
                  ((string=? op "-") ...)
                  ((string=? op "*") ...)
                  ((string=? op "/") ...)))
          
          ;;; An ArithmeticExpression is one of
          ;;;     -- a Literal
          ;;;     -- a Variable
          ;;;     -- an Operation
          ;;;     -- a Call
          ;;;     -- a Block
          ;;;
          ;;; OBSERVER TEMPLATE:
          ;;; arithmetic-expression-fn : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; ??
          #;
          (define (arithmetic-expression-fn exp)
            (cond ((literal? exp) ...)
                  ((variable? exp) ...)
                  ((operation? exp) ...)
                  ((call? exp) ...)
                  ((block? exp) ...)))
</pre>
        <p>
          The 18 functions you must define and <code>provide</code>
          are specified as follows:

          We will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set05/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "05" "q1.rkt")
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        (Constant Expressions)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this second problem, your job is to define several
          functions that classify and extract information from
          arithmetic expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll need the following definitions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An <em>operation expression</em> is an arithmetic expression
            that is either
            <ul>
              <li>
                an <code>Operation</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                or a <code>Block</code> whose body is an operation expression.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>constant expression</em> is an arithmetic expression
            that is either
            <ul>
              <li>
                a <code>Literal</code>,
              </li>
              <li>
                a <code>Call</code> whose operator is an operation expression
                and whose operands are all constant expressions,
              </li>
              <li>
                or a <code>Block</code> whose body is a constant expression.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>
          that defines all of the data types and functions
          defined in part 1 above, and also
          defines and provides the 4 functions specified below:

          ;;;     all blocks that occur within the expression, without
          ;;;     repetitions, in any order

          ;;; variables-used-by : ArithmeticExpression -&gt; StringList
          ;;; GIVEN: an arithmetic expression
