      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      programming with higher-order functions (HOFs).
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the directory with your solutions.
      Then import <code>rackunit</code> and this library
      by including the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file.
      Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates), contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests.
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      <span class="red">Be sure to report only the hours
      spent in that work session;
      do <strong><em>not</em></strong> report the cumulative time</span>.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add your work session report
      to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set06</code> directory.
      <strong><em>Do this at the end of every work session.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set06</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For question 1, you should require <code>rackunit</code> and
      <code>"extras.rkt"</code> but nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      For question 2, you should require <code>rackunit</code>,
      <code>2htdp/image</code>, <code>2htdp/universe</code>, and
      <code>"extras.rkt"</code>, but nothing else.

        <p>
          Rewrite your <code>q1.rkt</code> program from Problem Set 04
          to use higher-order functions instead of
          using recursions to traverse lists.
          Do this for all traversals in your program,
          not just in the deliverable functions.
          However, there may be functions in your program for which the
          use of higher-order functions is not possible
          or is not appropriate.
          Be prepared to defend your choices at codewalk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide the same
          functions as in Problem Set 04. Name your file
          <code>q1.rkt</code>, as in Problem Set 04.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Rewrite your <code>q2.rkt</code> program from Problem Set 04
          to use higher-order functions instead of
          using recursions to traverse lists.
          Do this for all traversals in your program,
          not just in the deliverable functions.
          However, there may be functions in your program for which the
          use of higher-order functions is not possible

          Provide the same

          <code>q2.rkt</code>, as in Problem Set 04.
