  <h3>
    Step 3: Method Design
</h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each method definition should have a contract that is the
        same as the contract in the interface.
        (In Java, the compiler enforces this.)
</li>
      <li>
        A method should have a purpose statement if that would
        be helpful to a reader.
        A public method's purpose statement may specialize
        the purpose statement given in an interface by adding
        details that explain how that purpose is achieved in
        this particular class.
</li>
      <li>
        Methods should have examples as needed to clarify the
        purpose statement.
</li>
      <li>
        Each method should have tests associated with it.
</li>
      <li>
        A method should have a design strategy if that would help
        readers to understand its definition.
</li>
      <li>
        A recursive method should have a halting measure if that would help
        readers to understand why it terminates.
</li>
</ul>
