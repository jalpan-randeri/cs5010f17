    <ul>
      <li>
        We no longer require you to state a design strategy
        for every function and method.
</li>
      <li>
        Early in the course, the design strategies you stated
        helped us to understand what you were trying to do
        even if your definition was completely wrong.
        As your programming skills have improved, that should
        happen less often now.
</li>
      <li>
        You should still state a design strategy if you think
        it would help readers to understand your definition.
</li>
</ul>
