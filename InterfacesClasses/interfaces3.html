      // This is a Java comment.
      //
      // You're looking at a file named Interface1.java,
      // which defines an interface named Interface1.
      //
      // That interface just lists the names and contracts
      // of three methods.
      //
      // In Java, as in most programming languages, you must
      // write down the contract for every method or function,
      // and the compiler enforces those contracts.  If you
      // write code that violates a contract, the compiler
      // won't let you run your program.
      //
      // Ordinarily, we would write a purpose statement
      // for each method, but we're leaving that out to
      // emphasize the simplicity of Java interfaces.
      
      interface Interface1 {
      
          int foo ();
          int bar (int n);
          int baz (int n);
      }

      <p>
        A few more comments about Java:
</p>
      <p>
        In Java, the names of most data types start with
        a capital letter, but Java treats a small set of
        primitive data types, such as <code>int</code>, differently.
        The capitalized data types are called <em>reference</em> types.
        The un-capitalized data types are the <em>primitive</em> types.
</p>
      <p>
        As you have probably noticed by now, a method's return
        type is written in front of the name of the method, and
        the type of each argument is written in front of the
        name of the argument.  That's a syntactic peculiarity
        Java copied from C.
</p>
      <p>
        Java copied many other syntactic peculiarities from C
        and other languages.  Having become popular, Java is
        now a language many other languages are copying.
