  <h3>
    Interfaces in Java
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In Java, every interface should go into a separate file,
      and those files should not contain anything except
      the interface definition and its comments.
</p>
    <p>
      The name of that file must be the name of the interface
      followed by the <code>.java</code> suffix, which indicates
      the file contains Java source code.
</p>
    <blockquote class="smaller">
      <p>
        For simplicity, we will put all of a program's
        <code>*.java</code> files into a single directory.
</p>
      <p>
        The Java system we will be using in this course
        requires a program's directory structure to be the same
        as its package structure.
        Putting all of a program's files into a single directory
        therefore implies we will be putting all of the program's
        code into the default package,
        which means you won't have to learn about Java packages.
</p>

      The next slide shows a complete example of a Java interface.
