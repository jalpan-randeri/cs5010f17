    Design Recipe in an OO System
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In an object-oriented system, the steps are similar
      but a little different.

          The Object-Oriented Design Recipe

          1. Interface Design
</td>
        <td>
          Identify the kinds of things in your system and
          the messages they need to respond to.
          For each method in an interface, write a contract
          and purpose statement.

      <tr>
        <td>
          2. Class Design
</td>
        <td>
          Identify the kinds of things that should implement
          each interface.  For each class, give a purpose
          statement.  For each field of a class, give an
          interpretation.
</td>
</tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          3. Method Definitions
</td>
        <td>
          For each method, copy the contract and purpose statement
          from the interface.  Specialize the purpose statement as
          necessary to
          explain how the purpose statement is fulfilled for this
          particular class.  Include examples as needed.

    <p>
      "Design Strategy" has been dropped as a separate step,
      but you should still describe a design strategy if you
      think it would help readers to understand your code.
      Most of the time, your methods will be so simple you
      probably won't need to describe a design strategy.
</p>
    <p>
      "Halting Measure" has been dropped as a deliverable,
      but you should still describe a halting measure for
      methods that might be involved in a recursion, unless
      the halting measure is obvious.
</p>
    <p>
      "Contract and Purpose Statement" is now part of the
      "Interface Design" and "Class Design" steps.
</p>
    <p>
      Unit tests are shown as the fourth step, after method
      definitions, but it is still a good idea to write at
      least some tests for each method after you write the
      contracts for the method and before you actually define
      the method.
