    <strong>Theorem.</strong>
    If f: N &rarr; R and g: N &rarr; R are non-negative
    for all arguments n, and g is in O(f) according to the
    <a href="lessGeneralBigO.html">
      less general definition,
    </a>
    then g is in O(f) according to the
    <a href="pageBigO.html">
      more general definition.
    </a>

    <strong>Theorem.</strong>
    If f: N &rarr; R and g: N &rarr; R are non-negative
    for all arguments n, and the constant function that
    always returns 1 is in O(f) according to the
    <a href="lessGeneralBigO.html">
      less general definition,
    </a>
    and g is in O(f) according to the
    <a href="pageBigO.html">
      more general definition,
    </a>
    then g is also in O(f) according to the
    <a href="lessGeneralBigO.html">
      less general definition.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, computer scientists who use the less general
    definition write O(f) only when f is positive-valued and
    monotonic, which implies the constant-valued
    function that always returns 1 is in O(f).

      <strong>Exercise:</strong>
      Can you give an example of a positive-valued function
      f: N &rarr; R for which (&lambda; n . 1) &notin; O(f)
      according to the less general definition?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The two theorems above therefore prove that, so far as
    computer scientists are concerned, the less general
    definition is basically the definition you'd get by
    restricting the more general definition to functions
    from the natural numbers to the positive real numbers.
