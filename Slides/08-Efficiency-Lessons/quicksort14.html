    Quicksort: run time for the best case
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The best case for <code>quicksort</code> is when the two lists
      returned by the call to <code>partition</code> are about the
      same length, which implies both are about half the length of
      the given list.
      If that happens on each recursive call,
      the lengths of the list for each call are as shown in the
      following tree, which is an abstraction of the computation
      graph.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Each node in the tree represents a call to <code>quicksort</code>,
      passing a list whose length is indicated by the label on the node.
      Each of those calls takes time roughly proportional
      to the length of the list, not including the recursive
      calls.
      That means the total time is roughly proportional to the sum
      of all labels in the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The height of the tree is &Theta;(lg n), and the labels at each
      level of the tree add up to n, so the best-case running time for
      <code>quicksort</code> is &Theta;(n lg n).
    </p>
    <p>
      That is also the average-case running time, assuming the lists
      to be sorted are in random order.
