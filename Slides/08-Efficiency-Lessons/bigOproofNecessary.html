  <h4>
    The Hypotheses Are Necessary
  </h4>
  <p>
    In the second theorem, the hypothesis that says
    (&lambda; n . 1) &isin; O(f)
    is annoying but necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the following functions:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      f(n) = min (1, 1/n)
    </p>
    <p>
      g(n) = 1
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Then g &isin; O(f) by the more general definition, but
    g &notin; O(f) by the less general definition.
  </p>
  <p>
    That means the less general definition is not exactly
    the same as the definition we'd get by restricting the
    more general definition
    to functions that accept only natural numbers as arguments.
  </p>
  <p>
    In computer science, the less general definition of O(f)
    is almost never used unless f is positive-valued and monotonic,
    which implies &nbsp; (&lambda; n . 1) &isin; O(f).
    That's why, in computer science, it is almost always safe to
    use the more general definition instead of the less general.
