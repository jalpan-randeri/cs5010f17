    Summary of Divide-and-Conquer Examples
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We have seen two examples of how a program can be made
      to run faster by computing less:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exponentiation can be made to run faster by first grouping
        multiplications so it becomes obvious that a subcomputation
        is being performed twice, and then to perform that
        subcomputation only once.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sorting can be made to run faster by dividing it into two
        subproblems, and then combining the sorted subproblems
        while using transitivity to avoid comparisons whose
        outcome is implied by previous comparisons.
        (In <code>quicksort</code>, the elements less than the
        pivot are all less than the elements that are greater
        than or equal to the pivot.
        In a merge sort, the lesser of the two first elements being
        compared during a merge is less than all of the other elements
        in both lists.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Those divide-and-conquer algorithms are moderately clever.
      They rearrange a computation to reveal subcomputations
      that don't have to be computed twice, or at all.
      Eliminating the unnecessary computations then makes the
      program run faster.
