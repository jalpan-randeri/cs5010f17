  <h4>
    The first rule: Don't
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      Many programs aren't worth optimizing at all,
      and most parts of most programs aren't worth optimizing
      because they are rarely executed or because they are
      already adequately efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're optimizing a program that gets run four times
      a year, and takes less than a minute each time it runs,
      you're wasting your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're optimizing some part of a program that gets
      run only at the start or end of the program, and accounts
      for only a small fraction of the overall run time, then
      you're wasting your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't waste your time.
      For most of the code you write, the first rule of
      optimization is all you need to remember: Don't.
