  <h4>
    The second rule: Don't Yet
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p>
      Even if a program you're writing will eventually need
      some optimization, you probably won't know which parts of it
      will need to be optimized until you've written the program
      and had a chance to measure its performance on realistic
      test data.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you begin to measure the performance of a program,
      you are likely to find that some parts of the program
      are already adequately efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also find that other parts of the program, which
      you thought would be adequately efficient, turn out to be
      where the program is spending most of its time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimization should be guided by actual measurements
      and profiling.
      If you're optimizing a program before you know where
      the program is spending its time,
      you are probably wasting your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a program you're writing will eventually need
      some optimization, you need to remember the second rule:
      Don't yet.
