    <p>
      People often get sloppy with big-O and related notations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have seen, O(f) is defined only when f is a function from
      some set X to the real numbers.  Furthermore, O(f) is a set of
      functions that have the same domain X as f.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly speaking, only the first example above is entirely
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second example, n<sup>2</sup> is an expression, not a function.
      Historically, expressions have been used interchangeably with
      functions because few people have known about lambda calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third example is similar, with two expressions being used
      where functions are necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth example shows a notational convention that's often
      used because it gets around having to use the symbol for set
      membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth example is just plain wrong, really, but you'll see
      it being used all over the place.  Just remember that all five
      of the examples are intended to mean what the first example
      expresses in correct mathematical notation.
